                         Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants,
                         twenty five years of blood sweat and tears,
                         and I'm never giving up, I'm just getting started.
                         We the best. Bless up. In life there will be road blocks
                         but we will over come it.
                         Stay focused. We don't see them, we will never see them.
                         How's business? Boomin. Let's see what Chef Dee
                         got that they don't want us to eat. Surround yourself with angels,
                         positive energy, beautiful people,
                         beautiful souls, clean heart, angel.")

                         The first of the month is coming,
                         we have to get money, we have no choice.
                         It cost money to eat and they don't want you to eat.
                         To be successful you've got to work hard, to make history,
                         simple, you've got to make it. Don't ever play yourself.
                         We don't see them, we will never see them. I'm up to something.
                         Special cloth alert. It's on you how you want to live your life.
                         Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean.)
